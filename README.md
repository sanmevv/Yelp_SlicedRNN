In this project, our aim is to conduct sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews from 2013, 2014, and 2015 by utilizing a sliced recurrent neural network architecture. Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in natural language processing as it involves extracting emotions, attitudes, and opinions from textual data. Yelp reviews offer valuable insights into customers' preferences and satisfaction levels, making sentiment analysis an essential task for businesses.

In our study, we compare the performance of our proposed sliced recurrent neural network architecture with four traditional machine learning models and two hybrid models that combine support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, as well as random forest and logistic regression. By doing so, we aim to determine the effectiveness of our architecture in accurately analyzing sentiment.

Furthermore, we also analyze the impact of our proposed architecture on users' cognitive abilities, including logical thinking and problem-solving skills. This assessment provides valuable insights into the potential benefits of using advanced deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis tasks.
